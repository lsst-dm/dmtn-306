abstract = {The CernVM File System (CernVM-FS) provides a scalable, reliable and close to zero-maintenance software distribution service. It was developed to assist HEP collaborations to deploy their software on the worldwide-distributed computing infrastructure used to run their data processing applications. CernVM-FS is deployed on a wide range of computing resources, ranging from powerful worker nodes at Tier 1 grid sites to simple virtual appliances running on volunteer computers. We present a new approach to stage updates and changes into the file system, which aims to reduce the delay in distributing a software release to less than an hour. In addition, it significantly reduces the complexity with respect to both required capabilities of the master storage as well as installation and maintenance. Furthermore, we will discuss new requirements for additional features on the client side that have arisen from HEP community feedback.}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {An important foundation underlying the impressive success of data processing and analysis in the ATLAS experiment [1] at the LHC [2] is the Production and Distributed Analysis (PanDA) workload management system [3]. PanDA was designed specifically for ATLAS and proved to be highly successful in meeting all the distributed computing needs of the experiment. However, the core design of PanDA is not experiment specific. The PanDA workload management system is capable of meeting the needs of other data intensive scientific applications. Alpha-Magnetic Spectrometer [4], an astro-particle experiment on the International Space Station, and the Compact Muon Solenoid [5], an LHC experiment, have successfully evaluated PanDA and are pursuing its adoption. In this paper, a description of the new program of work to develop a generic version of PanDA will be given, as well as the progress in extending PanDA's capabilities to support supercomputers and clouds and to leverage intelligent networking. PanDA has demonstrated at a very large scale the value of automated dynamic brokering of diverse workloads across distributed computing resources. The next generation of PanDA will allow other data-intensive sciences and a wider exascale community employing a variety of computing platforms to benefit from ATLAS' experience and proven tools.}
